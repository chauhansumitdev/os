OPERATING SYSTEM

old tech
batch processing
spooling

kernal + interface - os

microkernal structure
- rmeove all non essential components and implement them as system and user level programms

systems calls 

modes - user mode and kernel mode


process
process is the program in action/exec

program is pasive
process is active

every process has a PCB - process control block that contains the metedata of the process

process sections - text stack global-variables heap

process cycle 

schedulars - scheduling of the processes
types - 
long term
short term
medium term

schedulars -> dispatchers - dispatches the process 

context switch

cpu scheduling
process of determining which process in the ready queue is allocated to the cpu
first come first serve
shortest job next
priority
round robin
multilevel queue scheduling

types
non premptive jabtak chla chla - non forceful like if the process if finished or is waiting for the io then it is automatically stopped by itself
premptive - forcefully preventing the process form execution (eg priority scheduling if a process with higher priority enters then the current process need to be stopped)

Process sync and race conditions-
